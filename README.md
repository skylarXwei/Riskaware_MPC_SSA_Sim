# Riskaware_MPC_SSA_Sim

The Monte-Carlo Simulation result for Paper titled: "Moving Obstacle Avoidance: a Data-Driven Risk-Aware Approach" by Skylar X. Wei, Anushri Dixit, Shashank Tomar, and Joel W. Burdick can be found in this directory.

The .mat files includes all the simulation results that used to generate Table.1.
In addition, you may run MCsimulator_yalmip_ballistic.m, MCsimulator_yalmip_Frisbee.m, or MCsimulator_yalmip_constspd.m to generate your own results for ball with drag, Frisbee with drag, and const Speed cases, respectively.

You will need to download yalmip and gurobi to run the the mentioned document.

You may also find all the Monte-Carlo Simulation parameters in fun_ballistic_MC.m, fun_const_spd_MC.m, and fun_frisbee_MC.m files.
